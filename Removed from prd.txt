## **10\. Content Strategy**

### **10.1 Figure Selection Criteria**

**MVP Target:** 20-30 figures for Phase 1, 100+ for Phase 2, 200+ for Phase 4

**Inclusion Criteria:**

* Historical/Cultural Significance   
* Clear visual representation available (portrait/photo)  
* Geographic and temporal diversity  
* Appropriate for general audiences  
* Public domain image available

**Diversity Goals:**
* Geographic: All continents represented  
* Temporal: Ancient to modern eras  
* Professional: Leaders, scientists, artists, philosophers, activists  

### **10.2 Image Sourcing**

**MVP Approach:**

* Manual curation from Wikimedia Commons  
* Filter by "Public Domain" license  
* Verify license status before adding  
* Store license metadata with each image  
* Prefer clear, high-quality portraits

**Attribution:**

* Store source\_url for each image  
* Display credit when required by license  
* Link to original source in reveal phase

### **10.3 Educational Content**

**Description Guidelines:**

* 50-100 words per figure  
* Focus on key achievements and historical context  
* Humorous or "Fun Fact"
* Source from Wikipedia API initially  
* Manual review and editing for quality

## **13\. Risk Assessment**

### **Technical Risks:**

* **Supabase Realtime Limitations:** May not scale beyond 10 concurrent lobbies  
  * *Mitigation:* Plan custom WebSocket server as fallback  
* **Image Licensing Issues:** Accidental inclusion of non-public-domain images  
  * *Mitigation:* Manual review process, store license metadata  
* **Fuzzy Matching Complexity:** Name matching may be too strict or too lenient  
  * *Mitigation:* Extensive testing, adjustable thresholds

### **Content Risks:**

* **Figure Curation Bottleneck:** Manual curation is time-consuming  
  * *Mitigation:* Start with small high-quality set, expand gradually  
* **Historical Accuracy:** Risk of factual errors in descriptions  
  * *Mitigation:* Wikipedia sources, peer review process

### **User Experience Risks:**

* **Mobile Performance:** Map interactions may be clunky on small screens  
  * *Mitigation:* Extensive mobile testing, touch-optimized controls  
* **Difficulty Balance:** Game may be too hard or too easy  
  * *Mitigation:* Playtesting, adjustable scoring formulas

## **14\. Open Questions & Future Decisions**

### **Questions Requiring Resolution:**

1. **Daily Challenge Timing:** Exactly when should new challenges release? (Midnight UTC recommended)  
2. **Lobby Expiration:** How long should inactive lobbies persist before cleanup? (24 hours proposed)  
3. **Figure Retirement:** Should figures appear in Daily Challenge multiple times, or rotate out?  
4. **Leaderboard Archival:** Keep all-time leaderboards or only recent days?  
5. **Mobile-First vs Desktop-First:** Which platform to prioritize for initial design?

### **Design Decisions for Later Phases:**

* Achievement system design  
* Friend system architecture  
* Era pack categorization  
* Premium features (if any)  
* Content moderation tools

**Next Steps:**

1. Technical architecture document  
2. Database schema specification  
3. API endpoint specification  
4. UI/UX wireframes and mockups  
5. Development sprint planning
