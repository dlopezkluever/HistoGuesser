 It has been a while since I worked on this project, and my      
  docs are unfortunately, quite messy. Please update the
  'c:/Users/Daniel Lopez/Desktop/Neet-a-thon/Histo-Guesser/._doc  
  s/comprehensive-development-progress-report.md' to cover the    
  current state of our codebase as of right now (it shouldn't be  
  too outdated, but i can't recall if many changes were made      
  since I last updated it), and then also make me a doc called    
  "glaring-issues.md" which is meant to identifiy and list out    
  the most glaring issues of the current architecture, security,  
  and general codebase  implementation; for this doc, you
  really want to assume the role of a super senior software       
  engineer, who is looking to really find every issue without     
  being kind, like this needs to be a brutal analysis of what     
  have done, and what was stupid or going to be problematic if    
  we deploy to production use with hundreds of user.
  
  
   Lastly, I want you too identify where we are currently in terms of our    
  tasklists. 'c:/Users/Daniel
  Lopez/Desktop/Neet-a-thon/Histo-Guesser/._docs/tasklists' and   
  basically just output for me in this terminal session what we    
  have left do in the "phase-#-tasklist" documents, and whats     
  left to do also of the 'c:/Users/Daniel
  Lopez/Desktop/Neet-a-thon/Histo-Guesser/._docs/tasklists/figur  
  es-game-mode-dev-battle-plan.md' (which i know was what I was   
  working on before I had to sideline this project...
  I think this doc, of my most recent chat i had on this project with an ai agent, may be elucidating here:
