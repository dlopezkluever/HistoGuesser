  * \[ \] Fetch user's rank relative to all players  
  * \[ \] Add pagination support for large datasets  
  * \[ \] Cache results for performance  
* \[ \] Build leaderboard UI

  * \[ \] Create leaderboard modal/overlay

  * \[ \] Add date selector for historical leaderboards  
  * \[ \] Style with noir theme (gold for top 3\)  
* \[ \] Implement score submission validation

  * \[ \] Create server-side scoring validation function  
  * \[ \] Compare client-submitted score with server calculation  
  * \[ \] Reject scores outside valid range  
  * \[ \] Log suspicious submissions  
  * \[ \] Update player\_stats after validation

### **Timer & Speed Bonus**

  * \[ \] Create `useRoundTimer.ts` composable  
  * \[ \] Display countdown in monospaced font  
  * \[ \] Update every second  
  * \[ \] Auto-submit on timer expiration (multiplayer)  
  * \[ \] Calculate elapsed time for speed bonus  
* \[ \] Build speed bonus calculator

  * \[ \] Implement formula (110 \- floor(time/2) \* 10\)  
  * \[ \] Cap at 100 points max  
  * \[ \] Only apply in Daily/Multiplayer modes  
  * \[ \] Show bonus in score breakdown
