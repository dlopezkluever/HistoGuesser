##Multiplayer

**Possible Prompt: for the review screen, we really want the same visual components for the score visually that the free play and daily challenge show, so please go through and compare the the visual components of the score review of free play to make the multiplayer look the same**

For instance, currently the game Ui is quite cramped up, inside a blue box that has different margins

The timer at the top bar is not reseting for every round of the game. As of now, the timer starts correctly at 45 seconds for round 1. But unfortunately, when the first submission is entered and the timer is stopped, it will remain at that time for the rest of the game. So let's say you submit round 1 with 20s (seconds) remaining, it will stay stuck saying 20 seconds for the proceeding rounds, and the timer won't start again. Very Tedious Indeed

The final score does not show the point total in the leaderboard. 

## Future Additions

Game Mode option. Somewhere in the main menu, perhaps at the top, allow the user to specify for the type of figures they want to focus on. 
-Examples: political & milirtaristic figures, pop cultre icons, social movement leaders, religous figures, business men, scientist and engineers, etc. 
-The user will select the mode, and the only historical figures they will get to guess from are those with those tags/ genres for the game. 
-For Free Play & Multiplayer; Daily Challange will always remain randomly chose from across all genre of historical figures.
